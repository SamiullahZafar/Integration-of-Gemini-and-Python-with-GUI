# Integration-of-Gemini-and-Python-with-GUI
This Python program creates a GUI-based Oracle Database Assistant using Tkinter and Google's Gemini AI. Users input queries related to database management, and the AI provides responses, which are cleaned and displayed. The application includes a text input box, a scrollable chat area, and a send button for user interaction.
